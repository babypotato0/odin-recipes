    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Orange chicken is a popular item at Chinese restaurants. It consists of 
        small cubes of chicken that are breaded, pan-fried, and coated in an orange sauce. 
        The orange sauce is sweet with a little tang and a hint of spice. It's mainly 
        known for its orange flavor (as you can guess from the name). It's typically 
        made with orange juice and orange zest to achieve the citrus flavor.</p>

    <h5>Chicken</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange juice for 
        sauce into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in brown sugar, 
        green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes; bring 
        to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
        Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. 
        Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Reserve the remaining sauce.
        </li>

        <li>
        Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.
        </li>

        <li>
        Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned flour. 
        Seal the bag and shake to coat.
        </li>

        <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken 
        in the hot skillet until browned on both sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined 
        plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.
        </li>

        <li>
        Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
        </li>

        <li>
        Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth. Stir into the 
        boiling sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer, 
        stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
